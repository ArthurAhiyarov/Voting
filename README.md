# :raising_hand_man::raising_hand_man::raising_hand_man: Voting Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat console                       
npx hardhat coverage
npx hardhat create-ballot
npx hardhat create-winner-list
npx hardhat end-voting 
npx hardhat gas-reporter:merge       
npx hardhat get-ballot-info
npx hardhat get-candidate-votes-count
npx hardhat get-winner-list
npx hardhat verify
npx hardhat vote
npx hardhat withdraw-fee
```
